# Example Code to demonstrate the usage of zero copy

This example is removed since the release of RTI Connext 6.0. An example demonstrating Zero Copy Transfer over Shared Memory and its reduced latency benefits is available at  [FlatData and ZeroCopy Example](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-examples/tree/master/examples/connext_dds/flat_data_latency).
